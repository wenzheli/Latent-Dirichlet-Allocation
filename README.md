Java implementation for LDA (Collapsed Gibbs Sampling)
==========

The implementation contains: 
  - Collapsed Gibbs Sampler
  - Example application of online review mining. 

Reference:
  - David Blei's paper (2003)
  - Yelp Review Data Sets. http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/

I will add LDA derivation as technical note shortly.
